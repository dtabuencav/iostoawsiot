# iostoawsiot

This is a web app that allows you to publish data from your device's sensors (such as geolocation, device orientation, and device motion) to an AWS IoT topic. The app uses the AWS SDK for JavaScript and the Device Orientation and Device Motion APIs.

## Prerequisites
To use this app, you'll need:

- An AWS account
- An AWS Cognito Identity Pool ID
- An AWS IoT Core endpoint
- A web browser that supports the Geolocation API and either the Device Orientation or Device Motion API

## Setup
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a text editor.
Replace region and poolid with your AWS region and Cognito Identity Pool ID, respectively, in the JavaScript code.
Replace endpoint with your AWS IoT Core endpoint in the JavaScript code.
